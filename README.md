# White Knight

The 3rd place winning submission to Bored Pixels Jam 8.

The theme was "you are not the hero," thus, in this game you play the damsel in distress. Lead the equally brave and simple-minded hero through the dungeon and try not to die while he does heroic things like slay monsters, collect loot, and spout glib one-liners.
